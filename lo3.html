                        I analyzed competitors' websites to inform design decisions and aligned the new layout with industry standards. 
                        I chose a sailing company from my home country with an outdated website and crafted a new design emphasizing clarity and cleanliness. 
                        To reflect the company's sailing activities, I used relevant pictures and created a wavy design for sections with more text.
                         Important elements like the tours section were displayed with clear call-to-action buttons such as “Book now!” and “Learn more.”<br><br>
                        
                        Branding Project with Figma<br><br>
                        We began with <span class="highlight" id="highlight2">individual moodboards</span> and <span class="highlight" id="highlight3">brand guides</span>, exploring <span class="highlight" id="highlight4">simplistic</span> and uninspiring design prototypes. 
                        After receiving feedback, I proposed a transformative <span class="highlight" id="highlight5">new design</span> that received unanimous team approval and perfectly 
                        aligned with the client’s brand identity. This design was even used by the client for her <span class="highlight" id="highlight6">business cards.</span><br><br>
                        
                        Portfolio Development<br><br>
                        I experimented with <span class="highlight" id="highlight7">different styles</span> inspired by the ocean and simplicity before finalizing a design based on my 
                        country's history. I incorporated <span class="highlight" id="highlight8">symbols</span> from native Indian and Arawak tribe paintings found in Aruba’s caves and
                         created a <span class="highlight" id="highlight9">vision board</span> to guide the design process. After finalizing the aesthetic, I <span class="highlight" id="highlight10">began designing</span>, ultimately 
                         adding some color to enhance the design.<br><br>
                        
                        Explore Breda<br><br>
                        For the Explore Breda media campaign, I analyzed other cities' promotions and created initial poster designs 
                        targeting tourists. After feedback, I added a call to action and developed the <span class="highlight" id="highlight11">"Be romantic" poster</span>, which my team 
                        expanded into <span class="highlight" id="highlight12">three more posters</span>. <span class="highlight" id="highlight13">Further refinement</span> made the designs more readable and cohesive. This approach was also
                         applied to a campaign video.<br><br>

                        Project X <br><br>
                        I started by gathering user feedback through usability tests on Balashi Brewery’s website and drew inspiration from <span class="highlight" id="highlight14">other beverage sites designs</span>. 
                        <br><br>Designing with each beer’s target audience in mind, I created <span class="highlight" id="highlight15">personas and noted their flavors and characteristics</span>.
                        I crafted <span class="highlight" id="highlight16">three variations</span> of displays for each beer bottle, aiming for cohesive storytelling. 
                        For Balashi Beer, I used traditional, masculine elements. Chill featured beachy, relaxed graphics, 
                        while Magic Mango evolved to celebrate Aruba’s festivals.<br><br>Finally, I designed the website, 
                        inspired by the layout of <a href="https://drink818.com/">818 Tequila’s website</a>

                    <p>Redesigning the company website to industry standards enhanced user experience significantly. 
                        Creating an interactive Figma mockup for the branding project ensured it aligned perfectly with the client’s
                         brand identity, earning positive stakeholder feedback. Iterative design driven by feedback polished the portfolio
                          to meet project requirements and client expectations. Learning from the media campaign project improved design quality.
                           Implementing user feedback and industry insights in Project X enhanced website navigation and design, making it more 
                           user-friendly and engaging.
