                                I reviewed Balashi Brewery’s marketing strategies by analyzing their social media photos and videos. 
                                Ads for <span class="highlight" id="highlight2">Balashi</span> beer target an older, male audience with traditional Aruban cultural elements like domino games. 
                                <span class="highlight" id="highlight3">Chill</span> is marketed to a younger demographic as a beach beer, while <span class="highlight" id="highlight4">Magic Mango</span> appeals to a diverse audience with 
                                ads featuring social gatherings and celebrations.<br><br>

                    <p>The branding project ensured smooth progress and client satisfaction through clear communication and task 
                        organization. Adding e-commerce capabilities expanded market reach and improved competitiveness. 
                        The Explore Breda project benefited from targeted research, enhancing ad relevance and authenticity. 
                        Understanding tourist preferences and behaviors enhanced website user-friendliness, while competitor 
                        analysis helped Breda stand out. Analyzing Balashi Brewery’s social media confirmed target audiences: 
                        Balashi beer for older men with traditional Aruban elements, guiding heritage-focused designs; Chill for 
                        younger beach-goers, validating a beach-themed approach; and Magic Mango ads highlighting group celebrations, 
                        reinforcing its appeal for social events. This research informed effective audience targeting in my designs, 
                        resulting in informed, targeted outcomes for both projects.
