                <div class="accordion-content">
                    <p>Throughout semester 2, I developed two impactful prototypes.<br><br>

                        First, <span class="highlight" id="highlight1">"Octo-cooked"</span>, an interactive paper game, fostered teamwork, communication, and time
                        management skills, receiving positive feedback during trial runs.<br><br>

                        Second, in a branding project, we created an <span class="highlight" id="highlight2">"Interactive website mockup"</span> using Figma. Seeking
                        feedback from stakeholders like Mr. Amer and Jan enriched our understanding of project
                        requirements and enhanced the prototypes' effectiveness.<br><br>

                        Then, in Project X I Conducted user testing on Balashi Breweryâ€™s website to identify usability issues and
                        designed and developed an <span class="highlight" id="highlight3">interactive Figma prototype</span> for a revamped Balashi Brewery website.<br><br>

                        Lastly, I created a portfolio website showcasing semester projects, featuring sections like About Me, Projects, and Contact.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="accordion-item">
                <button id="accordion-button-2" aria-expanded="false"><span class="accordion-title">How I Did
                        It</span><span class="icon" aria-hidden="true"></span></button>
                <div class="accordion-content">
                    <p>We made Octo-Cooked interactive using paper and cardboard to conduct efficient user testing.
                        Every aspect, from the paper burger ingredients to the utensils, was digital. <br><br>
                        
                        For the branding project, we used an interactive mockup on Figma
                        to perform user testing efficiently, giving a clear preview of the final website.<br><br>

                        For Project X, I created a customized <span class="highlight" id="highlight4">usability test plan</span> 
                        based on a structure given to me by Amer for Balashi Brewery's website.
                        This plan, involved testing with five users: three local students and two teachers from outside Aruba. 
                        Their feedback guided the redesign process to enhance the website's user experience. <br><br>

                        I designed and structured my portfolio website using Figma, ensuring it was user/teacher-friendly. 
                        Content creation for this involved writing for the About Me page and detailing my process with multimedia on
                        the Learning Outcomes page. Development included HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for responsiveness and interactivity, 
                        with multimedia elements enhancing engagement. Feedback from teachers and peers drove iterative improvements in design,
                        functionality, and content.</p>

            <div class="accordion-item">
                <button id="accordion-button-3" aria-expanded="false"><span class="accordion-title">How It
                        Helped</span><span class="icon" aria-hidden="true"></span></button>
                <div class="accordion-content">
                    <p>Throughout the development process, we engaged with our peers in Mrs. Li's class, 
                        presenting various layout options and incorporating their input into our final design. 
                        This collaborative approach ensured that our prototype not only met the project criteria 
                        but also benefited from diverse perspectives, resulting in a refined and effective end product.
                        <br><br>Similarly, Project X benefited from structured usability testing, clarifying test goals and enhancing preparation. 
                        Moreover, my portfolio project integrated interactive media production comprehensively, spanning design, 
                        development, content creation, and user engagement.
